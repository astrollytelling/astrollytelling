# Astrollytelling: Astronomy + Scrollytelling
### A visualization project by Fernando Becerra and Jieun Choi.

Astrollytelling is an initiative of Fernando Becerra with the objective of bringing together astronomy and scrollytelling. Scrollytelling, as well as storytelling in general, has gained huge popularity in the last years, especially in journalism. It is used as a way to tell visual stories step by step by simply scrolling down a webpage. In this project we have adapted this technique to explain basic astronomy concepts and ideas. Originally aimed to undergrad and grad students, this visualization tool is also useful for any astronomy enthusiast who wants to learn more about the science we do.
