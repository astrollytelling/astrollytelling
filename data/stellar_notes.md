#PMS : Pre-Main Sequence

On the PMS, the star is contracting as it descends the nearly vertical track on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram known as the Hayashi track. The central density and temperature are not sufficiently high at this stage for hydrogen fusion in the core. Initially, the star is fully convective, but for stars more massive tha ~0.3 Msun, a radiative region develops as it approaches the MS.

#MS : Main Sequence

On the MS, the star is steadily fusing hydrogen to helium. Hydrogen-fusion takes place in a radiative core for stars like the Sun, but for more massive stars, it occurs instead in a convective core. The MS phase is the longest-lived stage of evolution leading up to the formation of a white dwarf. Stars harboring convective cores show a characteristic "hook" morphology as they leave the MS.
