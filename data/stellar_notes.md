#PMS : Pre-Main Sequence

On the PMS, the star is contracting as it descends the nearly vertical track on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram known as the Hayashi track. The central density and temperature are not sufficiently high at this stage for hydrogen fusion in the core. Initially, the star is fully convective, but for stars more massive tha ~0.3 Msun, a radiative region develops as it approaches the MS.

illustration: some dumb illustration showing the contraction. maybe mark the threshold Tc and rhoc somewhere?

#MS : Main Sequence

On the MS, the star is steadily fusing hydrogen to helium. Hydrogen-fusion takes place in a radiative core for stars like the Sun, but for more massive stars, it occurs instead in a convective core. The MS phase is the longest-lived stage of evolution leading up to the formation of a white dwarf. Stars harboring convective cores show a characteristic "hook" morphology as they leave the MS.

illustration: interior slices for three masses. fully convective, radiative core, convective core. a zoom/box around the hook?

#SGB+RGB : Subgiant Branch and Red Giant Branch

degenerate core
H shell burning
convective envelopes
ascending the Hayashi track
bright beacons useful for studying galaxies.
1/100 t_MS

illustration: interior structure of degenerate core and the H-shell

#CHeB : Core Helium Burning 

helium flash for stars below ~2 Msun
analogous to MS but now also shell burning
1/10 t_MS

illustration: show the interior structure. maybe show the off-center temperature profile---kinda cute?

#EAGB + TPAGB : Asymptopic Giant Branch

thermal pulses as the hydrogen and helium burning shells alternate switching on and off
shed most of the mass

illustration: show the interior structure with the degenerate C/O core and the two shells + envelope

#postAGB+WDCS : Post Asymptotic Giant Branch and White Dwarf Cooling Sequence

short lived post AGB: planetary nebula
white dwarf cools and fades away



note somewhere the mass of the star
linear age vs. logage?
combine early-AGB and TP-AGB to just AGB
diagrams?
