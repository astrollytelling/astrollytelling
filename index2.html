                    In order to better understand and interpret these systems and phenomena, we need to improve our
                    understanding of what is at the heart of it all: stars, and in particular, how different types of
                    stars evolve over time.

                    Fundamentally speaking, stars are simple, gravitationally- bound balls of gas powered by nuclear
                    fusion. We run computer simulations to model their evolution, which we can then compare to
                    observations. Any discrepancies can be investigated in more depth and what we learn from this
                    process can be used to help improve the models.

                    The following page will guide you through the life of a star that is only slightly more massive
                    than our own Sun.

                    We will use something known as the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR-diagram) to guide our
                    exploration.

                <section class="step">
                    The HR-diagram is a graph that shows the brightness of a star (luminosity) on the y-axis and the
                    temperature of the star on the x-axis.

                <section class="step" id="star-evol">
                    Since the star's brightness and temperature change over the course of its lifetime, we can graph
                    its life trajectory on the HR-diagram.

                    The HR-diagram is a powerful visualization and diagnostic tool frequently used by stellar
                    astronomers. Different types of stars show similar trends and behaviors when placed on the
                    HR-diagram, and we can make use of that fact to draw some physical meaning and intuition.

                    <p>On the PMS, the star undergoes contraction as it descends the nearly vertical track on the
                    Hertzsprung-Russell diagram known as the Hayashi track. The central density and temperature are
                    not sufficiently high at this stage for hydrogen fusion to take place in the center. All PMS
                    stars start out as fully-convective (energy is transported by large-scale turbulent motions, akin
                    to boiling water) objects, but for those that are more massive than ~0.3 Msun, a radiative region
                    (energy is carried away by photons) develops in the interior as they approach the MS</p>

                    The MS phase is the longest-lived stage of evolution leading up to the formation of a white dwarf.
                    For the Sun, this is expeced to last ~10 billion years. On the MS, the star steadily fuses
                    hydrogen to helium, which generates thermal energy and provides support against gravity.
                    Hydrogen-fusion occurs primarily via proton-proton chain for stars like the Sun, but in more
                    massive stars, the CNO-cycle dominates. Moreover, this process takes place in a radiative core
                    for stars like the Sun, but for more massive stars, it occurs in a convective core instead. Stars
                    harboring convective cores show a characteristic 'hook' morphology as they leave the MS.

                    <div class="title">Red Giant Branch</div>
                    Once the star runs out of its hydrogen fuel in the center, it can no longer produce enough energy
                    to hold up its own weight. As a result, the helium core begins to contract, releasing gravitational
                    energy in the process. This extra energy is deposited outside the helium core, which heats up the
                    layer and triggers hydrogen fusion in a shell. This so-called shell-burning is accompanied by an
                    expanding, cool, convective outer envelope. The star is now a red giant star and it continues to
                    become brighter and larger at a roughly constant temperature, tracing its path upward the Hayashi
                    track. This phase is expected to last only ~1.5 billion years for the Sun.

                    <div class="title">Core Helium Burning</div>
                    During the RGB phase, hydrogen shell-burning deposits freshly-fused helium on the inert helium
                    core as it continues to contract, making it both denser and more massive. Eventually, the core
                    becomes massive, dense, and hot enough for the onset of helium fusion. In stars below ~2 Msun,
                    ignition proceeds violently through a phenomenon known as the helium flash: the helium core is so
                    dense that the most central region becomes degenerate, which suffers an unstable, explosive
                    thermonuclear runaway reaction with the sudden ignition of helium. In stars above ~2 Msun, helium
                    ignites in a non-degenerate core and thus proceeds in a quiescent manner. Regardless of the
                    ignition condition, the star leaves the Hayashi track and is no longer a red giant, and helium
                    fusion ensues along with hydrogen shell-burning beyond the core. This phase is expected to last
                    only ~0.1 billion years for the Sun.

                    <div class="title">Asymptotic Giant Branch</div>
                    Eventually, the star runs out of helium fuel in the center. The carbon/oxygen core contracts and
                    the outer layers expand to form an AGB star, analogous to the RGB phase. In stars less massive
                    than ~8 Msun, the core cannot become dense and hot enough for carbon and oxygen to fuse into
                    heavier elements, and the central regions become degenerate. However, the contracting core releases
                    gravitational energy and heats up the layer above the carbon/oxygen core, which sets of helium
                    shell-burning. In turn, helium shell-burning deposits energy in the hydrogen layer above,
                    triggering hydrogen shell-burning as well. Throughout the AGB phase, hydrogen and helium
                    shell-burning alternate, giving rise to the well-known thermal pulses. These pulses are associated
                    with dense winds and a rich array of heavy elements synthesized through successive
                    neutron-captures called the s-process. Eventually, the AGB star sheds its envelope entirely,
                    leaving behind its hot carbon/oxygen core.

                    At this post-AGB phase, the bare, degenerate core is shrouded deep inside shells of gas it ejected
                    during the AGB phase. The core is hot and thus produces copious amounts of high energy photons
                    that ionize and light up the surrounding gas. Observationally, these objects correspond to
                    planetary nebulae. Though initially very hot, the central object quickly cools and can no longer
                    light up the surrounding gas that is also gradually dispersing into the interstellar medium. The
                    compact, central object that is left behind is now a white dwarf, which is supported against
                    gravity by electron degeneracy pressure. White dwarfs are notable for their incredibly high
                    density: approximately a solar mass's worth of material is packed inside a sphere the size of the
                    Earth.
